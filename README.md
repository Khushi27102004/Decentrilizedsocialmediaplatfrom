# Decentralized Social Media Platform

## Project Title
Decentralized Social Media Platform

## Project Description
The Decentralized Social Media Platform is a blockchain-based social network where users can publish content, engage with posts, and interact with advertisements, all managed on the Stellar blockchain. The platform leverages Lumens (XLM) as the native currency, enabling users to earn rewards for content creation, social engagement, and viewing or interacting with advertisements. The system is powered by smart contracts, ensuring transparency, security, and fairness in all interactions.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized social media ecosystem where creators and users are fairly compensated for their contributions and engagement. By removing centralized control, the platform will provide a more democratic environment for content creation and consumption, giving users the power to manage their data and interactions. This platform will promote freedom of expression while ensuring that every participant is rewarded for their time and efforts in a transparent manner.

## Key Features
- **Content Monetization**: Creators earn Lumens (XLM) for publishing high-quality content, with rewards based on engagement metrics.
- **User Engagement Rewards**: Users are rewarded for liking, commenting, and sharing content, encouraging active participation.
- **Decentralized Advertising**: Advertisers can place ads directly on the platform, paying Lumens (XLM) to users who interact with their ads, creating a fair ecosystem for advertisers and users alike.
- **Transparency and Fairness**: All interactions, payments, and transactions are managed through smart contracts, ensuring no manipulation or unfair distribution of rewards.
- **Data Ownership**: Users retain full ownership of their data, and all content is securely stored and managed on the blockchain.
